# If you are using the .zip or .tar.gz archives, the data and logs directories are sub-folders of $ES_HOME.
# If these important folders are left in their default locations, there is a high risk of them being deleted while upgrading Elasticsearch to a new version.
# In production use, you will almost certainly want to change the locations of the data and log folder:
path:
  logs: /opt/log/elasticsearch
  data: /opt/data/elasticsearch

cluster.name: asion-elasticsearch-cluster
node.name: ${HOSTNAME}

# By default, Elasticsearch binds to loopback addresses only — e.g. 127.0.0.1 and [::1]. This is sufficient to run a single development node on a server.
# Tip
# In fact, more than one node can be started from the same $ES_HOME location on a single node. This can be useful for testing Elasticsearch’s ability to form clusters, but it is not a configuration recommended for production.
# In order to communicate and to form a cluster with nodes on other servers, your node will need to bind to a non-loopback address. While there are many network settings, usually all you need to configure is network.host:
network.host: ${HOSTNAME}.kfk.com
# Port to bind to for incoming HTTP requests. Accepts a single value or a range. If a range is specified, the node will bind to the first available port in the range.
# Defaults to 9200-9300.
http.port: 9200-9300
# Port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range. If a range is specified, the node will bind to the first available port in the range.
# Defaults to 9300-9400.
transport.tcp.port: 9300-9400

# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
discovery.zen:
  #
  # Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when new node is started:
  # The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
  #
  ping.unicast.hosts: ["bigdata-node01.kfk.com", "bigdata-node03.kfk.com", "bigdata-node05.kfk.com"]
  #
  # Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of master-eligible nodes / 2 + 1):
  #
  minimum_master_nodes: 3
